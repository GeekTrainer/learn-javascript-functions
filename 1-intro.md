When we think about writing code, we always want to ensure our code is readable. While this sounds counterintuitive, code is read many more times than it's written. One core tool in a developer's toolbox to ensure maintainable code is the **function**. At its core, a function is a block of code we can execute on demand. This block of code might perform a task, such as navigate to a different part of a website, or calculate a value, like the sum of two numbers.

In this module you will learn:

- how to write a basic function
- what parameters are and how to use them
- how to use return values within functions
- how to use anonymous functions
