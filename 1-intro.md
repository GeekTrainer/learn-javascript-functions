When we think about writing code, we always want to ensure our code is readable. While this sounds counterintuitive, code is read many more times than it's written. One core tool in a developer's toolbox to ensure maintainable code is the **function**. 

In this module you will learn:
* how to write a basic function
* what parameters are and how to use them
* how to use anonymous functions

Prerequisites:
* A browser
* Basic knowledge of programming concepts
