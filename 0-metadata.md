# Creating modular code with functions in JavaScript

Functions are the building blocks for any application you will create. They allow you to create named, reusable sections of code to help make your code more readable and maintainable. This module will explore the core concepts of functions.

In this module you will learn:

- how to write a basic function
- what parameters are and how to use them
- how to use return values within functions
- how to use anonymous functions

Prerequisites:

- A browser
- Visual Studio Code and Live Server extension

Level: Beginner
Roles:
- Student
- Developer

## Introduction

Functions are core to any programming language. This module will help you get started with functions in JavaScript.

## Overview of functions

We start by exploring what a function is, and how to create your first function in JavaScript.

## Function parameters

Parameters allow you to pass values into a function to make it more reusable. We'll explore how to add parameters and use default values.

## Return values

Functions can return values, which is nice to allow functions to perform calculations or other operations which return results. We will see how to use return values in JavaScript functions

## Exercise - Create functions

You will create your first function in JavaScript.

## Anonymous functions

You may find yourself passing functions as parameters to other functions. To help streamline this process you can create a function without a name - an anonymous function. You will see how to create an anonymous function.

## Exercise: Using anonymous functions

You will create and use an anonymous function.

## Summary

You learned how to use functions in JavaScript.
